## Description:

* This website is designed to help professionals to track what tasks they need to work on during a work day schedule (9am-5pm).
* This project was completed based on the JavaScript Web API concepts, as well as utilizing third-party apis to efficiently perform the operations (Moment.js, Bootstrap, JQuery).
* I have learned the ways to implement third-party apis in order to efficiently write codes with less hassle. 


## Built By:
* HTML

1. All the grey blocks represent the past hour blocks, with red being the current hour, and green represents the future hours in a work day.
